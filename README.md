**Full-stack web development using .NET 5, React 17, and TypeScript 4**

## What is this book about?
The book starts by taking you through React and TypeScript components for building an intuitive single-page application and then shows you how to design scalable REST APIs that can integrate with a React-based frontend. Next, you’ll get to grips with the latest features, popular patterns, and tools available in the React ecosystem, including function-based components, React Router, and Redux. As you progress through the chapters, you'll learn how to use React with TypeScript to make the frontend robust and maintainable and cover key ASP.NET 5 features such as API controllers, attribute routing, and model binding to build a sturdy backend. In addition to this, you’ll explore API security with ASP.NET 5 identity and authorization policies and write reliable unit tests using both .NET and React, before deploying your app on Azure.
By the end of this book, you’ll have gained the knowledge you need to enhance your C# and JavaScript skills and build full-stack, production-ready applications with ASP.NET 5 and React.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Build RESTful APIs with .NET 5 using API controllers
* Secure REST APIs with identity and authorization policies
* Create strongly typed, interactive, and function-based React components using Hooks
* Understand how to style React components using Emotion.js
* Perform client-side state management with Redux
* Run a range of automated tests on the frontend and backend
* Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes in Azure using Azure DevOps

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you're a web developer looking to get up to speed with full-stack web application development with .NET Core and React, this book is for you. Although the book does not assume any knowledge of React, a basic understanding of .NET Core will help you to get to grips with the concepts covered.
